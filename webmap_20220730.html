Notwithstanding which, Extensive Grants have been made of the Territory claimed by the Algonquin, and Nepissingue Indians, without any compensation whatever being made to Them, although in all cases where Lands claimed by other tribes are required by Government, they have been Purchased at a Stipulated Price, or some other compensation made to the Indians in Obedience to His Majestys Commands.</p><p>The Algonquin, and Nipissingue, Indians, unlike the other Tribes in Lower Canada, do not Possess any Land from which a Revenue is derived, and have heretofore depended upon their Hunting for Support And although they have not failed to view the Progressive Settlement of Their Hunting Grounds as a Breach of His Majestys Proclamation, They for several years abstained from making any representation on the subject; but finding of late that the Settlement of the Country, and the indiscriminate, and injudicious destruction, by the Settlers, of the Beaver and other Animals, from which the most valuable Furs are obtained is likely soon to deprive Them of the means by which They have hitherto supported their Families, They very naturally solicited the interference of the Government.</p><p>Your letter of the 5th of August 1822 in answer to Their former Application, was to Them a source of much surprize, and dissatisfaction—In that Letter Their Request was not only refused, but They were informed that the other Tribes have an equal Right with Themselves to Hunt upon those lands which for ages have been reserved for Their use only –</p><p>Upon this subject, I deem it proper to observe to you, that the Hunting Grounds of the various Tribes of Indians Inhabiting these Provinces were originally defined among themselves, and the Boundaries of each Tract perfectly understood bv Them. Any encroachment by one Tribe upon the Lands allotted for the use of another, is viewed by Them in precisely the same light, as is, the Invasion of one Civilized State by another, and would occasion Hostility between Them, and I have reason to apprehend that should any of the other Tribes, upon the Authority of Your Letter, encroach upon the Hunting Grounds of these Indians, They will avail Themselves of that Power which Providence has given Them to resist such an attempt and it is very probable that if something is not done on the part of the Government to prevent the Settlers on the Grand River from Hunting upon the unoccupied Lands claimed by these Indians, some Lives will ere long be sacrificed</p><p>By the accompanying Plan, you will perceive that the Territory claimed by the Algonquin and Nipissingue, Indians, includes a considerable Portion of Settled Country; these Indians do not however ask, or expect, that what is already Granted will be restored to Them; All that They at present desire, is, that Government will secure to Them, by a written Instrument, the Exclusive Privilege of Hunting upon such Parts of the Tract claimed by Them, as are now unoccupied. That a Proclamation may be Issued Forbidding all Persons from encroaching Thereon and that in the Event of further Settlement of Their Lands, They may be compensated for the same, in such manner as will enable them to Support Their Families.</p><p>It appears to me that a due regard to Justice, and to the Benevolent Intentions of His late Majesty, as set forth in the aforementioned Proclamation, render a compliance with Their request both reasonable, and expedient; and when it is remembered that these Indians have been always distinguished for Their Loyalty, and general good Conduct, especially during the American Rebellion, when Their attachment to His Majestys cause was most Conspicuous, I trust that the countenance and Protection of Government will be extended to Them in such a manner as may convince Them that Their good conduct and Services are not forgotten.</p><p>I beg leave to enclose herewith a copy of an "Ordonnance" Issued in the year 1750 by the Marquis De La Jonquiere, at that time commanding in this country, which relates to the Encroachments of the Inhabitants upon a certain Tract of land reserved as Hunting Grounds for the Abenaquis Indians of St. Francois, and Forbids Them from encroaching Thereon for the future—something of the Same Kind would, I conceive, answer in the present Case, Forbidding all Persons from Hunting, or in any manner Trespassing upon the Lands claimed by the Algonquin and Nipissingue Indians, and reserved to Their use as Hunting Grounds by His Majestys Proclamation of 1763—and I request that you will be pleased to submit the same for the consideration of His Excellency the Major General Commanding the forces.</p><p>Libary and Archives Canada, RG10, Vol. 494, pp. 31,027-31,032, Reel C-13,341.

General Darling in their behalf:</p><p>The Deputation at the Same time declared with grief, that the late decision respecting their Hunting Grounds, has produced Serious disturbance among the Indians in this District, and is likely to lead to alarming and ruinous Consequences to their Tribes in particular, As the Iroquois, and other Indians. under Shelter of the present Regulation have been instigated by Several unprincipled Traders to plunder the Lands on the Ottawa River and Lake Nipissingue. which have been exclusively occupied by the Algonquin and Nipissing Tribes since the conquest of Canada and on which these Indians have been Nursing the Beaver and other wild Animals for some years past.</p><p>The Deputation Further stated that the late order, if enforced, will be the means of rendering the Individuals of their Tribes so many wandering Beggars throughout the Continent, as they are obliged to subsist entirely by the Chace [sic] and do not, like the Other Indians in Lower Canada possess any Seigneurial Lands or Property whatever.</p><p>The Deputation Stated in conclusion that their Tribes are and ever have been most anxious to preserve Peace and Good Order and to prove themselves deserving of His Lordship’s protection and good opinion, But that they may as well be exterminated at once, As to be deprived of their only means of support for their Numerous Families, and that their principal Chiefs cannot possibly Answer for what may happen should their Young People detect the Iroquois and other Indians in the Act of plundering their Lands.</p><p>The Deputation finally observed that as their Young Men are daily going off to their Hunting Grounds, the Chiefs are anxious to be favoured with His Lordships decision on their Petition as early as possible, with hope that it may avert the dreadful consequences likely to result to their Tribes from the excitement produced by the before mentioned Circumstances Among the Indians in the Montreal District.</p><p>The resident agent (James Hughes) replied to the delegation:</p><p>That He regretted it was not in his power to Communicate to them the pleasure of His Lordship the Commander of the Forces on the Petition of the Algonquin and Nipissingue Chiefs, as he had not as Yet been honored with any Instructions from the Dy Superintendent General respecting it; but that he would immediately ... Lay their request before M. General Darling, who he was Convinced would give all possible attention to their Complaints.</p><p>The Resident Agent then informed the Deputation of the Substance of a letter ... which He intended to forward by them to Captain Ducharme at their village, directing that officer to explain to the Indians Generally, and more especially to the Iroquois Tribe, the punishment that awaits them should they presume to Commit depredations upon any other Tribe of Indians in defiance of the positive commands of His Lordship ...</p><p>Libary and Archives Canada, RG10, Vol. 20, pp. 14,186-14,192, Reel C-11,004.
