Notwithstanding which, Extensive Grants have been made of the Territory claimed by the Algonquin, and Nepissingue Indians, without any compensation whatever being made to Them, although in all cases where Lands claimed by other tribes are required by Government, they have been Purchased at a Stipulated Price, or some other compensation made to the Indians in Obedience to His Majestys Commands.</p><p>The Algonquin, and Nipissingue, Indians, unlike the other Tribes in Lower Canada, do not Possess any Land from which a Revenue is derived, and have heretofore depended upon their Hunting for Support And although they have not failed to view the Progressive Settlement of Their Hunting Grounds as a Breach of His Majestys Proclamation, They for several years abstained from making any representation on the subject; but finding of late that the Settlement of the Country, and the indiscriminate, and injudicious destruction, by the Settlers, of the Beaver and other Animals, from which the most valuable Furs are obtained is likely soon to deprive Them of the means by which They have hitherto supported their Families, They very naturally solicited the interference of the Government.</p><p>Your letter of the 5th of August 1822 in answer to Their former Application, was to Them a source of much surprize, and dissatisfaction—In that Letter Their Request was not only refused, but They were informed that the other Tribes have an equal Right with Themselves to Hunt upon those lands which for ages have been reserved for Their use only –</p><p>Upon this subject, I deem it proper to observe to you, that the Hunting Grounds of the various Tribes of Indians Inhabiting these Provinces were originally defined among themselves, and the Boundaries of each Tract perfectly understood bv Them. Any encroachment by one Tribe upon the Lands allotted for the use of another, is viewed by Them in precisely the same light, as is, the Invasion of one Civilized State by another, and would occasion Hostility between Them, and I have reason to apprehend that should any of the other Tribes, upon the Authority of Your Letter, encroach upon the Hunting Grounds of these Indians, They will avail Themselves of that Power which Providence has given Them to resist such an attempt and it is very probable that if something is not done on the part of the Government to prevent the Settlers on the Grand River from Hunting upon the unoccupied Lands claimed by these Indians, some Lives will ere long be sacrificed</p><p>By the accompanying Plan, you will perceive that the Territory claimed by the Algonquin and Nipissingue, Indians, includes a considerable Portion of Settled Country; these Indians do not however ask, or expect, that what is already Granted will be restored to Them; All that They at present desire, is, that Government will secure to Them, by a written Instrument, the Exclusive Privilege of Hunting upon such Parts of the Tract claimed by Them, as are now unoccupied. That a Proclamation may be Issued Forbidding all Persons from encroaching Thereon and that in the Event of further Settlement of Their Lands, They may be compensated for the same, in such manner as will enable them to Support Their Families.</p><p>It appears to me that a due regard to Justice, and to the Benevolent Intentions of His late Majesty, as set forth in the aforementioned Proclamation, render a compliance with Their request both reasonable, and expedient; and when it is remembered that these Indians have been always distinguished for Their Loyalty, and general good Conduct, especially during the American Rebellion, when Their attachment to His Majestys cause was most Conspicuous, I trust that the countenance and Protection of Government will be extended to Them in such a manner as may convince Them that Their good conduct and Services are not forgotten.</p><p>I beg leave to enclose herewith a copy of an "Ordonnance" Issued in the year 1750 by the Marquis De La Jonquiere, at that time commanding in this country, which relates to the Encroachments of the Inhabitants upon a certain Tract of land reserved as Hunting Grounds for the Abenaquis Indians of St. Francois, and Forbids Them from encroaching Thereon for the future—something of the Same Kind would, I conceive, answer in the present Case, Forbidding all Persons from Hunting, or in any manner Trespassing upon the Lands claimed by the Algonquin and Nipissingue Indians, and reserved to Their use as Hunting Grounds by His Majestys Proclamation of 1763—and I request that you will be pleased to submit the same for the consideration of His Excellency the Major General Commanding the forces.</p><p>Libary and Archives Canada, RG10, Vol. 494, pp. 31,027-31,032, Reel C-13,341.

They already submitted several moons ago in a petition - that they are without land to provide for the subsistence of their families. You told them: “My children, wait, I will convey your words to our common father, beyond the great Lake, who will consider them, and will command me to grant you what you are asking from me.” What have you done for us, my father, since then? Nothing, at least to our knowledge, to grant what we asked you for then, except to tell us to go and hunt or live on the islands in the Ottawa. We went there and we found these islands occupied by other people with better title according to what they told us and who chased us away saying: “Leave, you have no right here, we forbid you to hunt and fish. If your father had granted you some rights, he would have granted them to you in writing.” And so, my father, these same persons, who were not afraid to scorn your word, feared even less chasing us off the land given to us by Lord Dorchester, which was little enough compensation compared to what we were entitled to expect from our good king.</p><p>My father, you want your children to love you, to be loyal to you, to follow you and to help you when you need help. Have they not done this? Look back and read the history of the last war. Who went first to the border and faced the enemy? Was it we, your children, or those to whom you have shown most favour? It was we the Algonquins and Nipissings who defended this land that we are asking you for today, that over which you govern. Other nations have done practically nothing, some were traitors to our father and they have been generously rewarded with lands. But for us, what have you done? Promises only. Perhaps, my father, some evil birds have advised you to do otherwise, have told you to grant nothing to the Algonquins and Nipissings. Alas, my father, know your children better, remember that an evil cloud has never darkened their ever-grateful hearts and observe that an Algonquin or Nipissing father gives up his portion to share it among his children, he carries them in his heart, their misfortunes become his own; in this way, he gains the affection of his children, they are loyal to him, they share with him their troubles, their sufferings and their joys; and you, my father, you see your children dying of hunger, without an inch of land back to which they can lead their hunger weakened livestock. Rejected everywhere, you forget them, you ignore them in the midst of plenty, you forget the distress of your children, you forget that the bodies of some of their ancestors, or rather their ashes, still attest to these exploits which were ever the mark of Braves and Warriors</p><p>Despite your neglect, your children still love you and cherish you; grant them, therefore, what they ask, land along the Ottawa or on the rivers that flow into it, that this land may belong to us. That we may be free there, we and our children forever, to hunt and fish there without anyone preventing us from doing so. We earnestly ask you this, so that we will be assured of a place where the bodies of our descendants may rest in peace, and be assured that we will not find ourselves in the dire situation where one day we are told [by our descendants] ... Beloved shades, precious bones of our dear ones, they are sending you and us far away from here; rise up and come and live with us in a strange land. Alas, my father, remember that some of this land you are living on today and over which you govern today once belonged to us; do not refuse us at least a little bit of it on which we may rest in the shade of your paternal goodness and your kindnesses.</p><p>By granting us this favour, or at least a reply to our request, you will find us at all times loyal children who will cherish you and pray that the precious days of their father may be preserved.</p><p>The following petitioners put their marks by their names, and these marks were certified by Ducharme, the Department interpreter</p><p>Algonquins Chiefs, Pierre Louis Penency, Ignas Meiachkowateh, Jappatist Kigons...</p><p>Nipissing Chiefs, Fill PaPino, J.

And so, we implore you to make our poverty known to our Brother His Excellency the Governor General who recently arrived, and who governs us. You are not unaware, Brother, that these past years, we have submitted a number of requests to the Fathers who governed us. But, unfortunately for us (perhaps because of their short stay among their Red Children or some other reason), we have never been able to have a definitive reply to our fair demands.</p><p>It would appear that our Father today, the Governor General, has more power than his Predecessors. They say he is good and generous, that he does Justice to his Red Children and White Children alike. That is all we are asking and all we are entitled to expect.</p><p>You know, Brother, our deplorable situation. You must remember the content of the Petitions we sent to several of our Fathers. These Petitions, or at least their copies, must be in Quebec City. Tell Our Father that we beseech him to read them, examine them and consider them seriously; and he will see at a glance that his Children, the Nipissings and Algonquins, are reasonable and are only asking for their rights: and tell him also that we are convinced he will do us Justice and that soon he will make his feelings known to us.</p><p>Brother, tell Our Father how we have been treated and scorned by the Whitemen who live on the banks of the Ottawa River. They take possession of our islands. They build here and there on our hunting grounds, without our permission or that of the Government. They ruin our Firewood without giving us anything; destroy our fur trade, drive off our deer, in short, they do us much harm. Before, the Whitemen who lived on our islands asked our permission to do so. They dealt honestly with us. They paid us an annual payment; we were satisfied with it and they remained there undisturbed. Now, only a few of the people pay us, although there are many who live on our islands. They laugh at us when we ask for payment They tell us: “Where are your Titles? Show them to us, and then we will pay you.” And so, Brother, be so good as to beseech our Father, on our behalf, to be good enough to give us a writing in his own hand giving us the power and authority to lease (but not sell), through the hands of one of our officers, for a specific period of time to be determined by our Father as he sees fit, these same islands which are reserved for us for our own benefit and use, located in the Ottawa River. One day, when our Father needs them, he will take them. We know he will give us some small annual payment.</p><p>Tell our Father who we are. Tell him his children, the Nipissings and Algonquins, have always been loyal subjects; that his predecessors, our Fathers, always found us ready to follow their commands. We have spilled our blood for our King and our country. And we are prepared to do so again, at any time, when our Father deems it necessary. We have nothing further to say; we leave everything in your hands. Explain the demands we are making of our Father, in our petitions, and tell him we hope he will answer us before we leave for our Hunting grounds. And, if possible, we would like to see him before our departure.</p><p>Done in good faith and trust us always.

I am very gratified of this, and hope that your trip will be propitious, and that you will be able to arrange all these affairs amicably, to the satisfaction of the Intruders, as well as to that of the Indians.</p><p>Firstly: As all the Islands in the Ottawa River form part of the Hunting Grounds allocated to the Algonquin and Nipissing Tribes, as well as all the lands situated on both banks of the River, which are not conceded, possessed, or erected into Townships by the Government; you will be pleased to warn and order all persons who might have taken possession of any of the said or other lands situated on the said Ottawa River without any authority to show you, to leave them as soon as possible; unless they judge, on the subject, with your consent, and that of the Chiefs and Warriors who may accompany you, in the name of the two Tribes, to make a kind of arrangement, for two or three years at the most, to hold occupation of the Island or land that they occupy. In that case, you have the power to make them a Lease for the above mentioned period in the names of the Chiefs and Warriors of the said Tribes, for a small remuneration (or rather rent) of a certain price fixed according to the size and the value of the land that they occupy, say a shilling for each arpent per year.</p><p>But it should be well understood that they have neither permission nor authority to cut timber in any quantity to sell.

Our Father Lord Metcalfe (at our said interview) requested us to make known and thoroughly explain to him on a piece of paper the injuries and grievances we had to complain of, that he would examine them and render us the justice we were entitled to. As our Good Mother across the Big Salt Lake has placed you in his chair we herewith send you the paper we were requested to prepare for him. It contains all we have to say in regard to the injuries and great injustices that have been done us; our mouths are not forked, Father, we speak straight and what we represented is the truth.</p><p>Father:</p><p>To make you thoroughly acquainted with the cause of our present most destitute and distressed situation we must go far back and therefore entreat and pray of you to be patient and to listen to our words and not only as our good Father Lord Metcalfe.

Justice, Father, is all we ask; it is what we are entitled to and expect at your hands.</p><p>Father,</p><p>As you are to us a stranger and perhaps ignorant of our claim as regards our rights, permit your Children Algonquins and Nipissings to point out to you the extent of the Hunting Grounds reserved to the Tribe by the Father of their ancestors, the King of France, and which they occupied and enjoyed long before the conquest of Canada. It began at Point dOrignal above the Long Sault on the Ottawa River and following up that River to Mattawang, thence up the Little River up to the banks Lake Nipissing, embracing both banks of the Ottawa, its Islands, adjacent countries, tributaries, streams, rivers and brooks from their sources; & heights of land that flow and empty themselves in said Ottawa River.</p><p>And moreover Father the said hunting grounds were reserved to our Tribes by a Proclamation signed by our late and good and lamented Father King George the Third dated 7th October 1763 and by the late Sir William Johnson Chief Superintendent of all the Indians in North America (who) assembled the principal Chiefs and warriors of our Tribes in Council and was pleased to appoint one of his officers, his representative to address the Council as we have always been given to understand by our Father and old Chiefs in the following words:</p><p>Address: My Children Algonquins and Nipissingues; By command of your Father Chief Superintendent Sir William Johnson I have assembled you in council to make your hearts dance with joy in announcing to you that your new Father King George, the Third, across the big Salt Lake has the interest of his Red Children at heart, he has not forgotten them as he is persuaded that should he at any time require their services they will be prompt to obey him. The hunting grounds, My Children, which your ancestors and yourselves have from time immemorial occupied and enjoyed and that have been the means of supporting and bringing up your families are reserved to you as heretofore by order of your Great and Good Father the King. No strangers, my children have a right to establish themselves on your hunting grounds nor molest you in any manner whatever. They are reserved to your tribe as hunting grounds for the sole benefit of yourselves and your Children. Your Great Father even forbids his first Officer or any other individual of making a survey of any part thereof or to purchase or otherwise to appropriate to themselves a single particle of your hunting grounds....</p><p>Permit your Children to represent to you that about fifty years ago or thereabout there was not a single white man’s establishment above the Long Sault with the exception of two or three huts of Canadian fur traders and these were not permitted to come without leave of Government. In these days Father we were happy, Rich and independent, we lived well made great hunts and had abundance of good clothing. Our hunting grounds were rich in more valuable furs and our magnificent Forests were well stocked with Deer, and small game of many species. No one in those days Father dared to molest us. It is only about the beginning of this century, Father, that a few indigent poor families who were starving and (as your Children Algonquins and Nipissings at present) who placed more confidence in their Indian Brethren for assistance than they did in our white Brethren found their way up to the Long Sault. Our Chiefs took pity on them, fed them, and allowed a piece of land on our hunting grounds to cultivate and support their families for which they were grateful and thankful.</p><p>But Father,</p><p>These interlopers some years afterwards began to increase annually. We perceived they would be an annoyance to us but forebore making use of force to expel them. We complained to our Father and Superintendent Sir William Johnston [sic], he promised to send them away but did not do so. Since that time Father, innumerable memorials have been sent by us with complaints praying for the removal of these squatters and lumberers from our Hunting Grounds, and we always received good words, and great promises from your predecessors, and were told that steps would be immediately taken to remove and punish these. But Father, these were but promises and so light that they were blown away by the first little wind and of course remain to be accomplished....</p><p>We your red Children Algonquins and Nipissingues are the true and identical children of the said (and according to the above mentioned Proclamation of our lamented good Father King George the Third, the sole proprietors of these (once) rich hunting grounds and majestic [illegible word] Forests but at the present day Father your Children are reduced to beggery caused principally by the innumerable squatters and lumberers who not content of taking possession & establishing themselves on the most fertile parts of our hunting grounds, destroying our magnificent forests and appropriating to themselves our fine timber now (but also) they most maliciously set fire to our woods, by which means they have destroyed our beavers and peltries, and driven away our Deer, the only dependance we had to support, clothe and bring up our children. We are often ill treated by these interlopers they take pleasure in destroying our patches of maize which we have here and there in cultivation for our winter flock and pillage and destroy our sugar bushes and when we threaten them with complaints to our Father they laugh at us & say it is from him that they receive licences to cut our timber. We are too weak Father to defend ourselves and obliged to put up with all these injuries and injustices.</p><p>It is with a sore heart we say it Father. It is the government who furnish licences to these lumberers and who connive with those squatters who take possession of part of our most valuable hunting grounds without our permission or authority from Government - and who owe us much money they formerly used to pay us a small sum of money for the use of the land they squatted on but now refuse to do so - saying that they are forbid by Government Who Father has established and is still establishing those numerous and flourishing townships on our Hunting grounds on the Ottawa River. It is government Father that same government which instead of protecting and assisting us (in conformity to the above mentioned Proclamation) is the principal cause of our principal great distress....</p><p>Joan Holmes & Associates Inc., <em>Report on the Algonquins of Golden Lake Claim</em>, Volume 2, pp. 119-124.
