<h2>The Akikodjiwan Historical Webmap</h2>

</header>

<p>Hello there. And thank you for visiting the <a href="index8.html">Chaudière Falls Historical Web Map</a>. My name is Samuel Mickelson and I am currently completing my Master of Arts in History at Carleton University on the traditional and unceded territory of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg. My research is focused on the history of the Chaudière Falls (known as <em>Akikodjiwan</em> and <em>Akikpautik</em> [Pipe Bowl Falls] among local Algonquin peoples) through the lenses of environmental history, Indigenous history, and settler colonialism. A deeply significant site in the Ottawa-Gatineau region, I am interested in exploring how the uses and meanings associated with the Chaudière Falls have shifted over time.</p>

<p>While human interaction with the Akikodjiwan dates back thousands of years, it was not until the early nineteenth century that the falls began to be harnessed for their hydraulic power and exploited for industrial purposes. Over the past three centuries, the falls have been developed, dammed, and reimagined many times over. Most recently, the islands that make up the Chaudière Falls site have been purchased and rezoned by a private real estate development group that is in the process of building a 34-acre mixed use residential and commercial development that they have named the <a href="https://zibi.ca/">"Zibi project."</a> The project has been celebrated by some and strongly opposed by others. In particular, the <a href="https://freethefalls.ca/">Free The Falls</a> group continues to call for the undamming of the falls and redevelopment of the site based on the late Algonquin elder William Commanda's <a href="https://asinabka.com/">Asinabka plan.</a></p>

<p>The Chaudière Falls Historical Web Map in this early phase can only gesture at this complex and contested history. I built this prototype for History 5706: Digital History with Dr. Shawn Graham in the fall of 2021. I have built the web map using <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> with the base map drawn from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=16/45.4204/-75.7128">OpenStreetMap</a> and the historical maps georectified using <a href="https://mapwarper.net/">MapWarper.</a> Given the time constraints of the course, I found most of the maps on the Library and Archives Canada online database. All of these maps have been digitized and are in the public domain. The only map used for the prototype that is not from Library and Archives Canada is the 2010 Victoria-Chaudière Islands Heritage District Master Plan by MTBA Associates Inc. I found this map on the <a href="https://mtbarch.com/portfolio/victoria-chaudiere-islands-heritage-district/">MTBA website</a> and the copyright is held by them.</p>

<p>An obvious limitation of the web map in its current state is the source of the maps. All of the maps--except for the one from MTBA Associates--are held by Library and Archives Canada and depict a settler colonial perspective of the falls. The earliest historical map that I have been able to find and georectify at this time is from 1825. Future work will include finding maps from other sources that represent the history of Akikodjiwan from an Indigenous perspective.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy browsing the web map and hopefully learn a few things while doing so. Please feel free to send any questions, comments, or suggestions to me at <a href="mailto:samuelmickelson@cmail.carleton.ca">samuelmickelson@cmail.carleton.ca</a>. I would love to hear from you. And any errors and omissions are mine and mine alone. Thank you for visiting.</p>
