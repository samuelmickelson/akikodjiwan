<h2>The Akikodjiwan Historical Webmap</h2>

</header>

<p>The <a href="webmap.html">Akikodjiwan Historical Webmap</a> (AHWM) is a digital mapping project that aims to cartographically represent the social, political, and environmental changes that took place at Akikodjiwan from 1800 to 1867. Akikodjiwan is the Algonquin term for the Chaudière Falls and the site encompasses the falls themselves—hemmed in by a ring dam since 1909—and the nearby Chaudière, Victoria, Albert, and Amelia Islands. Although Akikodjiwan has been a sacred site for the Algonquin peoples of the Ottawa Valley for thousands of years, the falls have undergone tremendous material transformations since the beginning of the nineteenth century. These drastic changes have been driven by the interlocking historical forces of settler colonialism and the dispossession of Algonquin Anishinaabeg lands.</p>

<p>By focusing on the critical period from 1800 to 1867, the AHWM seeks to make these interrelated and contested histories visible. These nearly seven decades saw non-Indigenous settlement begin and soon accelerate in the Ottawa Valley while Algonquin peoples were swiftly and systematically dispossessed of their lands. 1800 marks the arrival of Philemon Wright and his group of settlers on the north banks of the Kiji Sibi while 1867 marks Confederation and the establishment of Parliament Hill as the centre of Canadian state power just a few kilometres east of the falls. Akikodjiwan was fundamental to the social and political changes that occurred in the Ottawa Valley during these decades and the webmap seeks to cartographically depict the key policies, practices, and historical actors who made these transformations possible. The AHWM also seeks to foreground how Algonquin Anishinaabe peoples continued to assert their title to these lands even as their territories and livelihoods were being engulfed by the forces of settler colonialism.</p>

<p>The webmap in its current form is a proof-of-concept that has been developed using Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for webmapping. Four digitized historic maps of Akikodjiwan and the surrounding region were drawn from the collection of Library and Archives Canada (LAC) and georectified using Adobe Photoshop and an online tool called MapWarper. The georectified maps were then layered over a base map of the area in the present day drawn from OpenStreetMap. The georectified maps have also been geotagged with transcriptions of archival documents related to each map, including Algonquin and Nipissing petitions and textual records from the Philemon Wright and family fonds at LAC. In addition, Joan Holmes & Associates’ <em>Report on the Algonquins of Golden Lake Claim</em> (1993) has proved most helpful in providing translations for the Algonquin and Nipissing petitions that were originally written in French.</p>

<p>The AHWM is an ongoing project by Samuel Mickelson. I am a graduate student in the Department of History at Carleton University in Ottawa, ON. The project began as part of my Master of Arts at Carleton University and I intend to continue develop during my doctoral studies at Carleton beginning in September 2022. If you have any questions or thoughts to share, I would love to hear from you. I can be reached at <a href="mailto:samuelmickelson@cmail.carleton.ca">samuelmickelson@cmail.carleton.ca.</a></p>
