Notwithstanding which, Extensive Grants have been made of the Territory claimed by the Algonquin, and Nepissingue Indians, without any compensation whatever being made to Them, although in all cases where Lands claimed by other tribes are required by Government, they have been Purchased at a Stipulated Price, or some other compensation made to the Indians in Obedience to His Majestys Commands.</p><p>The Algonquin, and Nipissingue, Indians, unlike the other Tribes in Lower Canada, do not Possess any Land from which a Revenue is derived, and have heretofore depended upon their Hunting for Support And although they have not failed to view the Progressive Settlement of Their Hunting Grounds as a Breach of His Majestys Proclamation, They for several years abstained from making any representation on the subject; but finding of late that the Settlement of the Country, and the indiscriminate, and injudicious destruction, by the Settlers, of the Beaver and other Animals, from which the most valuable Furs are obtained is likely soon to deprive Them of the means by which They have hitherto supported their Families, They very naturally solicited the interference of the Government.</p><p>Your letter of the 5th of August 1822 in answer to Their former Application, was to Them a source of much surprize, and dissatisfaction—In that Letter Their Request was not only refused, but They were informed that the other Tribes have an equal Right with Themselves to Hunt upon those lands which for ages have been reserved for Their use only –</p><p>Upon this subject, I deem it proper to observe to you, that the Hunting Grounds of the various Tribes of Indians Inhabiting these Provinces were originally defined among themselves, and the Boundaries of each Tract perfectly understood bv Them. Any encroachment by one Tribe upon the Lands allotted for the use of another, is viewed by Them in precisely the same light, as is, the Invasion of one Civilized State by another, and would occasion Hostility between Them, and I have reason to apprehend that should any of the other Tribes, upon the Authority of Your Letter, encroach upon the Hunting Grounds of these Indians, They will avail Themselves of that Power which Providence has given Them to resist such an attempt and it is very probable that if something is not done on the part of the Government to prevent the Settlers on the Grand River from Hunting upon the unoccupied Lands claimed by these Indians, some Lives will ere long be sacrificed</p><p>By the accompanying Plan, you will perceive that the Territory claimed by the Algonquin and Nipissingue, Indians, includes a considerable Portion of Settled Country; these Indians do not however ask, or expect, that what is already Granted will be restored to Them; All that They at present desire, is, that Government will secure to Them, by a written Instrument, the Exclusive Privilege of Hunting upon such Parts of the Tract claimed by Them, as are now unoccupied. That a Proclamation may be Issued Forbidding all Persons from encroaching Thereon and that in the Event of further Settlement of Their Lands, They may be compensated for the same, in such manner as will enable them to Support Their Families.</p><p>It appears to me that a due regard to Justice, and to the Benevolent Intentions of His late Majesty, as set forth in the aforementioned Proclamation, render a compliance with Their request both reasonable, and expedient; and when it is remembered that these Indians have been always distinguished for Their Loyalty, and general good Conduct, especially during the American Rebellion, when Their attachment to His Majestys cause was most Conspicuous, I trust that the countenance and Protection of Government will be extended to Them in such a manner as may convince Them that Their good conduct and Services are not forgotten.</p><p>I beg leave to enclose herewith a copy of an "Ordonnance" Issued in the year 1750 by the Marquis De La Jonquiere, at that time commanding in this country, which relates to the Encroachments of the Inhabitants upon a certain Tract of land reserved as Hunting Grounds for the Abenaquis Indians of St. Francois, and Forbids Them from encroaching Thereon for the future—something of the Same Kind would, I conceive, answer in the present Case, Forbidding all Persons from Hunting, or in any manner Trespassing upon the Lands claimed by the Algonquin and Nipissingue Indians, and reserved to Their use as Hunting Grounds by His Majestys Proclamation of 1763—and I request that you will be pleased to submit the same for the consideration of His Excellency the Major General Commanding the forces.</p><p>Libary and Archives Canada, RG10, Vol. 494, pp. 31,027-31,032, Reel C-13,341.

They already submitted several moons ago in a petition - that they are without land to provide for the subsistence of their families. You told them: “My children, wait, I will convey your words to our common father, beyond the great Lake, who will consider them, and will command me to grant you what you are asking from me.” What have you done for us, my father, since then? Nothing, at least to our knowledge, to grant what we asked you for then, except to tell us to go and hunt or live on the islands in the Ottawa. We went there and we found these islands occupied by other people with better title according to what they told us and who chased us away saying: “Leave, you have no right here, we forbid you to hunt and fish. If your father had granted you some rights, he would have granted them to you in writing.” And so, my father, these same persons, who were not afraid to scorn your word, feared even less chasing us off the land given to us by Lord Dorchester, which was little enough compensation compared to what we were entitled to expect from our good king.</p><p>My father, you want your children to love you, to be loyal to you, to follow you and to help you when you need help. Have they not done this? Look back and read the history of the last war. Who went first to the border and faced the enemy? Was it we, your children, or those to whom you have shown most favour? It was we the Algonquins and Nipissings who defended this land that we are asking you for today, that over which you govern. Other nations have done practically nothing, some were traitors to our father and they have been generously rewarded with lands. But for us, what have you done? Promises only. Perhaps, my father, some evil birds have advised you to do otherwise, have told you to grant nothing to the Algonquins and Nipissings. Alas, my father, know your children better, remember that an evil cloud has never darkened their ever-grateful hearts and observe that an Algonquin or Nipissing father gives up his portion to share it among his children, he carries them in his heart, their misfortunes become his own; in this way, he gains the affection of his children, they are loyal to him, they share with him their troubles, their sufferings and their joys; and you, my father, you see your children dying of hunger, without an inch of land back to which they can lead their hunger weakened livestock. Rejected everywhere, you forget them, you ignore them in the midst of plenty, you forget the distress of your children, you forget that the bodies of some of their ancestors, or rather their ashes, still attest to these exploits which were ever the mark of Braves and Warriors</p><p>Despite your neglect, your children still love you and cherish you; grant them, therefore, what they ask, land along the Ottawa or on the rivers that flow into it, that this land may belong to us. That we may be free there, we and our children forever, to hunt and fish there without anyone preventing us from doing so. We earnestly ask you this, so that we will be assured of a place where the bodies of our descendants may rest in peace, and be assured that we will not find ourselves in the dire situation where one day we are told [by our descendants] ... Beloved shades, precious bones of our dear ones, they are sending you and us far away from here; rise up and come and live with us in a strange land. Alas, my father, remember that some of this land you are living on today and over which you govern today once belonged to us; do not refuse us at least a little bit of it on which we may rest in the shade of your paternal goodness and your kindnesses.</p><p>By granting us this favour, or at least a reply to our request, you will find us at all times loyal children who will cherish you and pray that the precious days of their father may be preserved.</p><p>The following petitioners put their marks by their names, and these marks were certified by Ducharme, the Department interpreter</p><p>Algonquins Chiefs, Pierre Louis Penency, Ignas Meiachkowateh, Jappatist Kigons...</p><p>Nipissing Chiefs, Fill PaPino, J.
