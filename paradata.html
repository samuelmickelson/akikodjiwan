<h2>Paradata document or a description of my methods</h2>

<p>The Akikodjiwan Historical Webmap (AHWM) began as a term project in the fall of 2021 for a graduate-level digital history course with Dr. Shawn Graham at Carleton University. The aim at that time was to gain some experience working with Historical GIS (HGIS) methods related to my own research interests. What started as an interest in the histories of settler colonialism and Algonquin dispossession in the Ottawa Valley developed into an idea to explore these historical processes as they unfolded at one key site in the region during the nineteenth century: Akikodjiwan or the Chaudière Falls.</p>

<p>At the outset I wanted to gain some proficiency in common GIS software such as ArcGIS or QGIS. However, it soon became clear that the learning curve for these programs would be too steep if I wanted to complete a prototype by December 2021. After discussing these concerns with Dr. Graham, he suggested that I explore working with Leaflet. While not a GIS program, Leaflet provided many of the tools that I was looking for to cartographically represent the changes that took place at Akikodjiwan during the nineteenth century. And I soon learned that webmapping tools like Leaflet are in many ways more suitable than GIS programs for sharing geospatial data and analyses with a wider audience. Still, I was and remain intrigued by the more sophisticated analytical possibilities of GIS programs for conducting historic research.</p>

<p>For now at least, the AHWM is based on Leaflet. This has meant developing some basic proficiency in JavaScript and finding digitized maps of Akikodjiwan from the nineteenth century held by Library and Archives Canada (LAC). All of these maps are in the public domain so I encountered no issues regarding permissions. I georectified the maps using an online tool called MapWarper—and later received some help improving the georectification with Adobe Photoshop—and added them as layers to a base map of Akikodjiwan and its immediate vicinity in the present day drawn from OpenStreetMap. I then used longitudinal and latitudinal data to add several geotagged points to each layer of the webmap. All of these elements formed the basis of the AHWM.</p>

<p>The next set of additions to the webmap came during summer 2022 when I decided to develop the project as a case study for the Major Research Essay of my Master of Arts at Carleton. This work involved archival research at LAC and going through Joan Holmes & Associates’ <em>Report on the Algonquins of Golden Lake Claim</em> (1993) to identify primary sources that related to the maps of Akikodjiwan that I had found several months before. I selected documents from the Philemon Wright and family fonds at LAC and petitions from Algonquin and Nipissing Chiefs to colonial authorities. Many of these petitions are available at LAC and in the <em>Report on the Algonquins of Golden Lake Claim</em>. The Holmes report also includes translations of petitions that were originally composed in French which proved very helpful. After selecting key Algonquin and Nipissing petitions and documents from the Philemon Wright and family fonds, I transcribed these and added them to the geotagged points on the webmap. These transcripts appear as popups when a user clicks on a geotagged point. I also added narrative introductions for some of the most important documents.</p>

<p>This is where things stand with the webmap today. That said, it is envisioned as an ongoing and iterative project. The AHWM is grounded in the principles of flexibility and adaptability. This means that future work will likely include exploring other webmapping tools and GIS software such as ArcGIS and QGIS. Another area of improvement is to add audiovisual and visual sources that document the history of Akikodjiwan from Algonquin perspectives. At this time, the Algonquin sources on the webmap consist of the petitions to colonial officials. While these primary sources are very useful, they employ the tropes that were common in correspondence between Indigenous peoples and British colonial authorities at the time. The petitions were also composed by government interpreters or scribes albeit likely dictated by the Algonquin and Nipissing Chiefs who signed them. These limitations must therefore be kept in mind when interacting with these petitions and I hope that adding different kinds of Algonquin sources will help fill in the gaps. I intend to work on these and other enhancements to the webmap over the course of my doctoral studies beginning in September 2022. With these ideas in mind, I expect the form and content of the webmap to change as the project progresses.</p>
