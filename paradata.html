<h2>Paradata document or a description of my methods</h2>

<p>The Akikodjiwan Historical Webmap (AHWM) began as a term project in Fall 2021 for a graduate-level digital history course with Dr. Shawn Graham at Carleton University. The aim at that time was to gain some experience working with Historical GIS (HGIS) methods related to my own research interests. What started as an interest in the histories of settler colonialism and Algonquin dispossession in the Ottawa Valley developed into an idea to explore these historical processes as they unfolded at one key site in the region during the nineteenth century: Akikodjiwan or the Chaudière Falls. As I started thinking about these topics, the significance of Akikodjiwan soon become apparent to me. Not only was it central to non-Indigenous settlement of the Ottawa Valley during this period, it is also very much part of the public consciousness in the National Capital Region today. In particular, the 34-acre Zibi project currently under construction at Akikodjiwan has served as a flashpoint for public conversations regarding the future of the Ottawa-Gatineau region, environmental sustainability, and reconciliation with Algonquin peoples. HGIS and related digital mapping tools seemed to offer many possibilities for the exploration of these histories because as many scholars have pointed out settler colonialism is fundamentally about the dispossession of Indigenous lands and the transplantation of a settler society onto those same territories. I wanted to know whether HGIS methods could contribute to historical understandings of how these processes played out Akikodjiwan.</p>

<p>At the start, I wanted to gain some proficiency in common GIS software such as ArcGIS or QGIS. However, it soon became clear that the learning curve for these programs would be way too steep if I wanted to complete a prototype by December 2021. From discussing my ideas with Dr. Graham, I also learned that webmapping tools like Leaflet are in some ways more suitable for engaging with the historical questions that I am interested in. While GIS software offers powerful tools for analyzing spatial data, webmapping tools are arguably more effective at representing spatial data.</p>

<p>So I got to work building a prototype with Leaflet. In particular, this involved developing some basic proficiency in the JavaScript code on which Leaflet is based and finding some digitized historic maps of Akikodjiwan that I could use. I found these in the collection of Library and Archives Canada (LAC). All of these maps are in the public domain so I encountered no issues in terms of adding them to the webmap. I georectified these maps using an online tool called MapWarper and added them as layers to a base map of the area in the present day. I then added some geotagged points to each layer using longitudinal and latitudinal data. All of these elements formed the basis of the AHWM.</p>

<p>The webmap sat dormant for the next several months until I was able to revisit it during summer 2022 as the digital component for my Major Research Essay. After conducting archival research at LAC and going through Joan Holmes & Associates’ Report on the Algonquins of Golden Lake Claim (1993), I identified primary sources that related to the maps of Akikodjiwan that I had found several months before. These included documents from the Philemon Wright and family fonds at LAC and petitions from Algonquin and Nipissing Chiefs to colonial officials regarding the dispossession of their lands. I transcribed the most significant of these primary sources and added them to the geotagged points on the webmap. At the same time, I reduced the number of historic maps to focus on the period from 1800 to 1867 and I made the georectification more precise. I also spent time improving the accuracy of the geotagged points on each historic map. The result is a webmap that I believe demonstrates some of the historical processes of settler colonialism and Algonquin dispossession as they unfolded at Akikodjiwan during early to mid-nineteenth century. But the final word will rest with those who interact with the webmap and read this paper.</p>

<p>Future work will include improving the aesthetics and user experience of the webmap. I would like to make the experience of interacting with the maps and documents more seamless. I would also like to be add audio, audiovisual, and photographic sources as a way to build more Algonquin perspectives of the history of Akikodjiwan into the webmap. It is possible that there are more suitable webmapping or HGIS tools than Leaflet for building this kind of webmap. There are many other tools available that I have only briefly explored such as KnightLab’s StoryMap JS and Google My Maps. I am also interested in learning QGIS or ArcGIS. It is possible that GIS software would offer possibilities for studying the history of Akikodjiwan that I have not even considered. The main point is that I have designed the AHWM as a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the value of digital mapping methods as a form of historical inquiry for studying the overlapping histories of settler colonialism and Algonquin dispossession in the Ottawa Valley. I have designed the webmap with the principles of flexibility and adaptability in mind. I intend to build on this work over the course of my doctoral studies beginning in September 2022. And I hope that the results of the AHWM in its current form will speak for themselves.</p>
